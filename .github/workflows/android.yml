Okay, you want to change the step in your GitHub Actions workflow that currently runs `./gradlew lint` to run your actual unit tests instead.
To run standard unit tests (those typically located in `app/src/test/java/your/package/name/`) in a Gradle project, you use the `test` task.
Here's how you should modify that step in your `.github/workflows/android_ci.yml` file:
**Current Step (Running Lint):**


```
- name: Run Unit Tests # Add a step for running unit tests
  run: ./gradlew lint
```


**Modified Step (Running Unit Tests):**


```
- name: Run Unit Tests
  run: ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```


**Explanation of `testDebugUnitTest`:**
*   `test`: This is the general Gradle task for running tests.
*   `Debug`: This specifies that you want to run tests associated with the `debug` build type. If you have different tests for different build types (e.g., `release`), you might choose `testReleaseUnitTest`. For most CI scenarios, `testDebugUnitTest` is appropriate.
*   `UnitTest`: This clarifies that you are running local unit tests (JVM tests), not instrumented tests (which run on an Android device or emulator and would typically use a task like `connectedDebugAndroidTest`).
**Your updated GitHub Actions workflow file would look like this:**


```kotlin
name: Android CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "master"
      # You might want to add other branches you push to, e.g., 'develop'
      # - "develop"
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "master"
      # You might want to add other branches you open PRs against
      # - "develop"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: 'gradle'

    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      run: chmod +x gradlew

    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: ./gradlew build # This will also compile your tests

    - name: Run Unit Tests
      run: ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest # Changed this line
